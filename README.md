# 🧮 Simple Calculator — Shristy Sharma

Welcome to my **Simple Calculator Project**, built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates my ability to create a **fully functional web-based calculator** with a clean design and simple user interactions.

## 📌 **About This Project**

This is a basic calculator app that I, **Shristy Sharma**, created as a practical exercise to strengthen my understanding of:
- **HTML5** structure.
- **CSS3** styling and responsive design.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** DOM manipulation and event handling.

It’s a perfect beginner-friendly example of combining **frontend technologies** to build something interactive.
